## Dev Technical Guidance

### Firebase Authentication Setup
- Use Firebase v9 modular SDK as specified in `docs/ubuntu-connect-architecture.md#definitive-tech-stack-selections`
- Configure authentication providers in Firebase Console with South African region settings
- Implement custom claims for cultural representative permissions (future use)
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-architecture.md#authentication-service`

### Cultural Identity Data Structure
```typescript
interface CulturalIdentity {
  id: string; // e.g., 'zulu', 'xhosa', 'afrikaans'
  name: string; // Display name in user's language
  description?: string; // Brief cultural context
  verified: boolean; // Community verification status
}

interface UserProfile {
  uid: string; // Firebase Auth UID
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  culturalIdentities: string[]; // Array of cultural identity IDs
  culturalPreferences: {
    openToDiversity: boolean;
    preferredLanguage: string;
    culturalExchangeInterest: boolean;
  };
  privacy: {
    profileVisibility: 'public' | 'communities' | 'private';
    culturalIdentityVisible: boolean;
    locationSharing: boolean;
  };
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  lastActive: Timestamp;
}
```

### Component Architecture
- Follow feature-based structure: `src/features/auth/components/`
- Use compound components for registration wizard: `<RegistrationWizard><BasicInfo /><CulturalIdentity /></RegistrationWizard>`
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-frontend-architecture.md#detailed-frontend-directory-structure`

### Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines
- All cultural identity options must be reviewed by cultural representatives
- Use respectful, authentic cultural names and descriptions
- Avoid cultural stereotypes or oversimplification
- Implement cultural content moderation pipeline for user-generated cultural descriptions
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-ui-ux-specification.md#cultural-design-principles`

### Mobile Optimization
- Implement touch-optimized form controls (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Use progressive enhancement for cultural identity selection (works without JavaScript)
- Optimize for South African mobile data costs with aggressive caching
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-frontend-architecture.md#performance-considerations`

### POPIA Compliance Implementation
- Implement granular consent management for cultural data collection
- Provide clear data usage explanations in user's preferred language
- Enable data portability and deletion rights
- Log consent decisions with timestamps for audit trail
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-architecture.md#security-best-practices`

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for registration form validation with cultural names
- Integration tests for Firebase Auth flows
- E2E tests for complete registration journey including cultural identity selection
- Accessibility testing with screen readers in multiple languages
- Performance testing on 3G networks with South African latency simulation
- Cultural sensitivity testing with cultural representative review

### Error Handling
- Implement culturally sensitive error messages
- Provide fallback authentication methods for network issues
- Handle cultural identity validation errors gracefully
- Support offline registration with sync when connection restored
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-frontend-architecture.md#error-handling--retries-frontend`
