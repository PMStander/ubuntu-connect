## Dev Technical Guidance

### Cultural Identity Data Model
```typescript
interface CulturalIdentity {
  id: string; // e.g., 'zulu', 'xhosa', 'afrikaans'
  name: string; // Display name in multiple languages
  description: string; // Cultural context and background
  region: string; // Geographic association
  language: string[]; // Associated languages
  traditions: string[]; // Key cultural traditions
  verified: boolean; // Community verification status
  connectionTypes: ('heritage' | 'interest' | 'learning' | 'family' | 'community')[];
}

interface UserCulturalProfile {
  culturalIdentities: {
    identityId: string;
    connectionType: 'heritage' | 'interest' | 'learning' | 'family' | 'community';
    verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'community_endorsed';
    addedDate: Timestamp;
    description?: string; // Personal cultural connection story
  }[];
  culturalPreferences: {
    openToDiversity: boolean;
    culturalExchangeInterest: boolean;
    culturalLearningGoals: string[];
    respectfulInteractionMode: boolean;
  };
  culturalPrivacy: {
    identitiesVisible: boolean;
    culturalStoryVisible: boolean;
    culturalInteractionsVisible: boolean;
    culturalAnalyticsOptIn: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Progressive Profile Building Architecture
- Use React Hook Form with multi-step wizard pattern
- Implement local storage for draft profile data with encryption
- Create cultural context provider for identity information
- Use Firestore subcollections for profile sections to enable granular privacy
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-frontend-architecture.md#state-management-in-depth`

### Cultural Sensitivity Implementation
- All cultural identities must be reviewed by cultural representatives
- Implement cultural appropriation detection through community reporting
- Use respectful language and avoid cultural stereotypes
- Provide educational context for each cultural identity
- Enable community-driven cultural authenticity verification

### Privacy Controls Architecture
```typescript
interface PrivacySettings {
  profileVisibility: 'public' | 'communities' | 'private';
  culturalIdentityVisibility: {
    [identityId: string]: 'public' | 'communities' | 'private' | 'hidden';
  };
  locationSharing: {
    enabled: boolean;
    precision: 'exact' | 'city' | 'province' | 'country';
    visibleTo: 'public' | 'communities' | 'connections';
  };
  skillsVisibility: 'public' | 'communities' | 'private';
  analyticsOptIn: boolean;
  culturalInteractionTracking: boolean;
}
```

### Cultural Validation Workflow
- Implement cultural representative approval queue
- Create community endorsement system with reputation scoring
- Add cultural authenticity verification through multiple community members
- Build escalation process for cultural appropriation concerns
- Track cultural verification metrics for platform health

### Mobile Optimization
- Progressive profile building with save/resume functionality
- Touch-optimized cultural identity selection with search
- Image upload optimization for South African mobile networks
- Offline profile editing with sync when connection restored
- Cultural context tooltips optimized for mobile viewing
