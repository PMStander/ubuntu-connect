5. Audit logging for security monitoring with cultural data protection
6. Secure token management with automatic refresh and cultural session state
7. Device management and session termination capabilities
8. Cultural data encryption at rest and in transit
9. POPIA-compliant consent management with granular permissions
10. Security monitoring and anomaly detection for cultural data access

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Authentication Architecture
```typescript
interface AuthenticationConfig {
  providers: {
    email: boolean;
    google: boolean;
    facebook: boolean;
    phone: boolean;
  };
  twoFactorAuth: {
    enabled: boolean;
    methods: ('totp' | 'sms' | 'backup_codes')[];
    enforcement: {
      culturalRepresentatives: boolean;
      adminUsers: boolean;
      optionalForUsers: boolean;
    };
  };
  sessionManagement: {
    tokenExpiry: number; // 24 hours
    refreshTokenExpiry: number; // 30 days
    maxConcurrentSessions: number; // 5 devices
    culturalContextPreservation: boolean;
  };
}

interface SecurityAuditLog {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  action: 'login' | 'logout' | 'password_reset' | 'cultural_data_access' | 'profile_update';
  timestamp: Timestamp;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  culturalContext?: {
    culturalDataAccessed: string[];
    culturalPermissionsUsed: string[];
    crossCulturalInteraction: boolean;
  };
  securityLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  result: 'success' | 'failure' | 'blocked';
}
```

### POPIA Compliance Implementation
- Implement granular consent management for cultural data collection
- Create clear data usage explanations in user's preferred language
- Build data retention policies with cultural content considerations
- Add right to deletion with cultural community impact assessment
- Implement data portability for cultural profiles and contributions

### Two-Factor Authentication Setup
```typescript
interface TwoFactorAuthSetup {
  totpSecret: string; // Encrypted TOTP secret
  backupCodes: string[]; // Encrypted backup codes
  smsPhoneNumber?: string; // South African phone number
  isEnabled: boolean;
  setupDate: Timestamp;
  lastUsed?: Timestamp;
  culturalSecurityEducation: {
    completed: boolean;
    completionDate?: Timestamp;
  };
}
```

### Session Management Architecture
- Use Firebase Auth with custom claims for cultural representatives
- Implement secure session storage with cultural context preservation
- Create device management interface for session termination
- Add session analytics with cultural interaction tracking
- Build session security monitoring with anomaly detection

### Cultural Data Encryption
```typescript
interface CulturalDataEncryption {
  encryptionKey: string; // User-specific encryption key
  culturalIdentityEncrypted: boolean;
  culturalContentEncrypted: boolean;
  crossCulturalMessagesEncrypted: boolean;
  encryptionMethod: 'AES-256' | 'ChaCha20-Poly1305';
  keyRotationSchedule: number; // Days between key rotation
}
```

### Security Monitoring Implementation
- Implement real-time security event monitoring
- Create cultural data access pattern analysis
- Build automated threat detection for cultural appropriation attempts
- Add security alerting for cultural representative account access
- Implement incident response procedures for cultural data breaches

### Password Reset Security
- Multi-channel password reset with cultural context
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Security questions with cultural sensitivity
- Account recovery through cultural community verification
- Secure reset token generation with expiration

### Mobile Security Considerations
- Biometric authentication support for mobile devices
- Secure storage of cultural data on mobile devices
- Mobile-specific security threats mitigation
- Cultural data protection during mobile app backgrounding
- Secure cultural content caching on mobile devices
