```typescript
interface CulturalContent {
  id: string;
  type: 'history' | 'tradition' | 'recipe' | 'language' | 'achievement' | 'story';
  title: string;
  content: string; // Rich text content
  culturalContext: {
    primaryCulture: string;
    relatedCultures: string[];
    historicalPeriod?: string;
    geographicRegion: string;
    culturalSignificance: string;
  };
  media: {
    images: MediaFile[];
    videos: MediaFile[];
    audio: MediaFile[];
    documents: MediaFile[];
  };
  attribution: {
    primaryAuthor: string; // User ID
    contributors: string[]; // User IDs
    culturalExperts: string[]; // Cultural representative IDs
    sources: string[]; // External sources and references

  };
}

interface MediaFile {
  id: string;

    culturalSensitivity: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'needs_revision';
    factualAccuracy: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'needs_revision';
    communityGuidelines: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'needs_revision';
  };
  feedback: {
    culturalContext: string;
    improvementSuggestions: string[];
    culturalAccuracyNotes: string;
  };
  escalation: {
    required: boolean;
    reason?: string;
    escalatedTo?: string;
  };
}
```
