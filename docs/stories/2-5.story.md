## Dev Technical Guidance

### Interactive Map Implementation
```typescript
interface CulturalMap {
  regions: CulturalRegion[];
  connections: CulturalConnection[];
  viewState: {
    selectedRegion?: string;
    hoveredRegion?: string;
    zoomLevel: number;
    centerPoint: [number, number];
  };
  interactionMode: 'explore' | 'learn' | 'connect';
}

interface CulturalRegion {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  svgPath: string; // SVG path for region boundary
  culturalGroups: string[];
  demographics: {
    population: number;
    languages: string[];
    traditions: string[];
  };
  contentSummary: {
    totalContent: number;
    categories: Record<string, number>;
    recentAdditions: string[];
  };
}
```

### Cultural Content Discovery Architecture
- Implement Elasticsearch or Algolia for advanced cultural content search
- Create cultural content recommendation engine using collaborative filtering
- Build cultural similarity algorithms based on traditions, languages, and history
- Use Firebase Firestore for real-time cultural content updates
- Reference: `docs/ubuntu-connect-architecture.md#cultural-content-api`

### Language Learning Integration
```typescript
interface LanguageLearningResource {
  language: string;
  culturalContext: string;
  basicPhrases: {
    phrase: string;
    pronunciation: string;
    audioUrl: string;
    culturalUsage: string;
    situations: string[];
  }[];
  culturalEtiquette: {
    greetings: string[];
    respectfulCommunication: string[];
    culturalTaboos: string[];
  };
  learningPath: {
    beginner: string[];
    intermediate: string[];
    advanced: string[];
  };
}
```

### Offline Cultural Content Strategy
- Implement service worker for cultural content caching
- Create cultural content prioritization for offline storage
- Build progressive sync for cultural content updates
- Add offline cultural map functionality with cached regions
- Implement offline cultural learning progress tracking

### Cultural Discovery Analytics
```typescript
interface CulturalDiscoveryAnalytics {
  userId: string;
  discoverySession: {
    sessionId: string;
    startTime: Timestamp;
    culturesExplored: string[];
    contentViewed: string[];
    crossCulturalConnections: number;
    learningPathProgress: Record<string, number>;
  };
  culturalInterests: {
    primaryInterests: string[];
    emergingInterests: string[];
    culturalCuriosity: number; // 0-100 score
  };
  learningProgress: {
    culturesStudied: string[];
    contentCompleted: string[];
    achievements: string[];
    culturalKnowledgeScore: number;
  };
}
```
