## Dev Technical Guidance

### AI Moderation Pipeline Architecture

```typescript
interface AIModerationPipeline {
  contentId: string;
  analysisSteps: {
    culturalSensitivity: {
      score: number; // 0-100, higher = more sensitive
      detectedIssues: string[];
      culturalContext: string[];
      riskFactors: string[];
    };
    culturalAppropriation: {
      detected: boolean;
      confidence: number;
      appropriatedCulture: string;
      originalCulture: string;
      severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
    };
    inappropriateContent: {
      flagged: boolean;
      categories: ('hate_speech' | 'misinformation' | 'harmful_stereotypes')[];
      confidence: number;
    };
    culturalAccuracy: {
      score: number; // 0-100
      verifiedFacts: number;
      questionableClaims: string[];
      requiredVerification: boolean;
    };
  };
  overallRisk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  recommendedAction: 'auto_approve' | 'human_review' | 'cultural_expert' | 'reject';
  culturalRepresentativeRequired: string[]; // Culture IDs
}
```

### Cultural Representative Workflow

```typescript
interface CulturalModerationTask {
  id: string;
  contentId: string;
  assignedRepresentative: string;
  culturalExpertise: string[]; // Required cultural knowledge areas
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  deadline: Timestamp;
  moderationSteps: {
    culturalAccuracy: {
      status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'needs_revision' | 'rejected';
      score: number; // 1-5 rating
      notes: string;
      requiredChanges: string[];
    };
    culturalSensitivity: {
      status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'needs_revision' | 'rejected';
      concerns: string[];
      recommendations: string[];
    };
    culturalContext: {
      accurate: boolean;
      additions: string[];
      corrections: string[];
    };
    communityImpact: {
      assessment: 'positive' | 'neutral' | 'potentially_harmful';
      reasoning: string;
      mitigation: string[];
    };
  };
  decision: {
    action: 'approve' | 'request_revision' | 'reject' | 'escalate';
    reason: string;
    feedback: string;
    nextSteps: string[];
  };
  escalation?: {
