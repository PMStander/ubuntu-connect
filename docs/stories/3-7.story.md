## Dev Technical Guidance

### Cultural Heritage Content Architecture
```typescript
interface CulturalHeritageContent {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'story' | 'tradition' | 'artifact' | 'recipe' | 'music' | 'dance' | 'language' | 'history';
  culturalGroup: string[];
  region: string;
  media: {
    images: MediaFile[];
    videos: MediaFile[];
    audio: MediaFile[];
    documents: MediaFile[];
  };
  metadata: {
    creator: string; // User ID
    contributors: string[]; // User IDs
    culturalRepresentativeApproval: string; // Representative ID
    dateCreated: Timestamp;
    lastModified: Timestamp;
    provenance: string; // Source and historical context
    culturalSignificance: 'public' | 'community_only' | 'sacred' | 'restricted';
    tags: string[];
    language: string;
    region: string;
  };
  validation: {
    status: 'draft' | 'pending_review' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'needs_revision';
    reviewedBy: string[]; // Cultural representative IDs
    reviewNotes: string[];
    communityEndorsements: number;
    accuracyScore: number; // 0-100
  };
  preservation: {
    archivalQuality: boolean;
    backupLocations: string[];
    digitalPreservationMetadata: Record<string, any>;
    culturalContextPreserved: boolean;
  };
}

interface CommunityMembership {
  userId: string;
  communityId: string;
  role: 'member' | 'moderator' | 'organizer';
  joinDate: Timestamp;
  culturalContribution: {
    eventsOrganized: number;
    projectsLed: number;
    crossCulturalConnections: number;
    culturalBridgeScore: number; // 0-100
  };
  locationVerification: {
    verified: boolean;
    verificationMethod: 'gps' | 'address' | 'community_endorsement';
    verificationDate?: Timestamp;
  };
}
```

        memberCount: number;
        percentage: number;
        recentGrowth: number;
      };
    };
    diversityIndex: number; // Shannon diversity index
    evenness: number; // How evenly distributed cultures are
    bridgeConnections: number; // Cross-cultural connections within community
  };
  trends: {
    monthlyDiversityChange: number;
    newCulturalGroups: string[];
    culturalEventParticipation: Record<string, number>;
  };
  recommendations: {
    culturesToEncourage: string[];

    sharedResources: string[];
    communityContributions: Record<string, string[]>;
    fundingNeeds: number;
  };
  impact: {
    participantCount: number;
