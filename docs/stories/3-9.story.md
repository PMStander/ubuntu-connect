# Story 3-9: Content Discovery & Curation

## Status: Review

## Story

- As a Ubuntu Connect user seeking cultural learning and content discovery
- I want intelligent content discovery and curation tools that respect cultural sensitivities and provide personalized recommendations
- so that I can discover relevant cultural content, learn about different traditions, and contribute to accurate cultural representation while preventing misappropriation

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Intelligent content recommendation engine respecting cultural sensitivities and user preferences
2. Cultural content moderation system with community representatives and AI-assisted validation
3. Trending cultural topics discovery with regional and cultural relevance
4. Personalized cultural learning dashboard showing progress and recommendations
5. Content verification system ensuring cultural accuracy and preventing misrepresentation
6. Cultural appropriation prevention with education and community oversight
7. Content curation by cultural representatives and community experts
8. Integration with heritage documentation and knowledge sharing systems
9. Mobile-optimized discovery with offline content access and sync capabilities
10. Multi-language content discovery with cultural context preservation

### AC 3-9.2: Cross-Cultural Matching Algorithm
**Given** I have specified my cultural learning goals and interests  
**When** the system generates community recommendations  
**Then** the algorithm should:
- Prioritize communities with high cultural diversity scores
- Consider my current cultural network gaps
- Factor in geographic proximity for offline engagement opportunities
- Include communities where my cultural background is underrepresented
- Balance between comfort zone and growth opportunities

### AC 3-9.3: Bridge-Building Opportunity Suggestions
**Given** I have an established profile with community engagement history  
**When** I view my recommendations  
**Then** I should see:
- Special "Bridge Builder" opportunities highlighted
- Communities where I could serve as a cultural representative
- Cross-community collaboration projects I could join
- Mentorship opportunities based on my cultural knowledge
- Events where my cultural perspective would be valuable

### AC 3-9.4: Recommendation Reasoning & Transparency
**Given** I am viewing community recommendations  
**When** I select a "Why recommended?" option  
**Then** I should see:
- Clear explanation of why this community was suggested
- How it aligns with my stated cultural learning goals
- What unique cultural perspectives I might gain
- How my background could contribute to the community
- Expected mutual benefit assessment

### AC 3-9.5: Dynamic Recommendation Updates
**Given** I have joined new communities or updated my cultural profile  
**When** I return to the recommendations section within 24 hours  
**Then** the system should:
- Refresh recommendations based on new community memberships
- Adjust diversity calculations to reflect current network
- Remove communities I've already joined or explicitly dismissed
- Surface new opportunities based on recent community activities
- Maintain recommendation quality with fresh suggestions

### AC 3-9.6: Cultural Learning Path Recommendations
**Given** I have expressed interest in learning about specific cultures  
**When** I view advanced recommendation options  
**Then** I should see:
- Structured learning paths through multiple related communities
- Progressive cultural immersion opportunities
- Communities arranged by cultural learning difficulty
- Integration with knowledge exchange mentorship opportunities
- Cultural event participation recommendations
