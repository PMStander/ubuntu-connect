- Reviews and success stories from previous mentees
- Available time slots and preferred communication methods
- Cultural learning bonuses (e.g., language practice, cultural insights) included with skill learning

### AC 4-10.3: Cross-Cultural Learning Session Management
**Given** I have been matched with a mentor or mentee from a different cultural background  
**When** I schedule and conduct learning sessions  
**Then** the system should provide:
- Scheduling tools that respect cultural calendars and preferences

- Apply cultural exchange bonuses for cross-cultural interactions
- Track my time credit balance with detailed transaction history
- Suggest ways to use earned credits for further learning opportunities
- Provide quality metrics that affect credit earning rates
- Enable gifting of time credits to community members in need

### AC 4-10.5: Cultural Context Integration
**Given** I am engaged in cross-cultural skill sharing  
**When** I participate in any knowledge exchange activity  
**Then** the system should:
- Highlight cultural aspects relevant to the skill being shared
- Provide cultural background about different approaches to the skill
- Suggest cultural immersion opportunities related to the skill
- Track my cross-cultural competency development
- Connect skill learning with broader cultural understanding
- Offer language practice opportunities related to the skill domain
