# South African Cultural Unity Platform - Project Brief

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Ubuntu Connect (working title)  
**Vision:** Create a digital platform that celebrates South Africa's cultural diversity while building genuine bridges between communities  
**Mission:** Transform the "15% divisive vs 85% unity-seeking" dynamic by providing a space where South Africans can be proud of their individual cultures while working together to build the nation

### Core Concept
A web platform with a central South Africa hub that branches out to showcase different cultures (Zulu, Afrikaner, Xhosa, Indian, Coloured, etc.), then reconnects them through shared achievements, collaborative projects, and knowledge exchange.

## Firebase Implementation Strategy

### Database Structure (Firestore)
```javascript
// Collections Structure
users/
  - {userId}
    - profile: {name, bio, cultures, location, skills}
    - achievements: {badges, contributions, recognition}
    - preferences: {language, interests, notifications}

cultures/
  - {cultureId}
    - info: {name, description, history, traditions}
    - members: {userIds array}
    - content: {stories, media, events}

communities/
  - {communityId}
    - type: "location" | "culture" | "activity"
    - members: {userIds with roles}
    - projects: {active collaborations}
    - events: {upcoming activities}

achievements/
  - {achievementId}
    - category: "sport" | "culture" | "community" | "national"
    - details: {description, media, recognition}
    - cultural_connection: {how it relates to different cultures}

projects/
  - {projectId}
    - participants: {cross-cultural team members}
    - type: "service" | "cultural" | "educational"
    - status: "planning" | "active" | "completed"
```

### Authentication Strategy
- **Multi-provider:** Email, Google, Facebook, phone number
- **Progressive signup:** Minimal initial registration, profile building over time
- **Cultural sensitivity:** Optional cultural identification, never forced

### Security & Moderation
- **Firebase Security Rules** for data protection
- **Cloud Functions** for content moderation
- **Community reporting** system with escalation
- **POPIA compliance** built into data handling
