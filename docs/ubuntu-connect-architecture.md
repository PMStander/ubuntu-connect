# Ubuntu Connect Architecture Document

## Introduction / Preamble

This document outlines the comprehensive technical architecture for Ubuntu Connect, a culturally sensitive platform designed to unite South Africa through cross-cultural collaboration while celebrating individual heritage. The architecture prioritizes mobile-first design, real-time collaboration, cultural content moderation, and scalability to support 100,000+ concurrent users across 11 official languages.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
A separate Frontend Architecture Document will detail the React-based Progressive Web App (PWA) design and MUST be used in conjunction with this document. Core technology stack choices documented herein are definitive for the entire project.

## Technical Summary

Ubuntu Connect employs a serverless microservices architecture using Firebase ecosystem within a monorepo structure. The system combines React 18+ PWA frontend with Firebase Cloud Functions backend, Firestore NoSQL database, and real-time collaboration features. Key architectural decisions prioritize mobile-first performance for South African networks, multi-language support with cultural context preservation, AI-powered content moderation, and scalable cross-cultural matching algorithms.

## High-Level Overview

**Architecture Style:** Serverless Microservices with Event-Driven patterns
**Repository Structure:** Monorepo containing React frontend and Firebase Cloud Functions backend
**Primary Data Flow:** User → PWA → Firebase Auth → Cloud Functions → Firestore → Real-time Updates

The system enables cross-cultural collaboration through location-based, culture-based, and activity-based communities, with real-time translation and cultural sensitivity features integrated throughout.

## Architectural / Design Patterns Adopted

- **Serverless Microservices** - _Rationale:_ Auto-scaling Firebase Cloud Functions enable handling variable loads from cultural events and cross-cultural interactions without infrastructure management
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - _Rationale:_ Real-time cultural interactions, community updates, and cross-cultural matching require immediate event propagation
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - _Rationale:_ 79% mobile usage in South Africa requires offline capability and app-like experience without app store dependencies
- **Repository Pattern** - _Rationale:_ Abstraction layer for Firestore operations enables testing and potential future database migrations
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** - _Rationale:_ Separate read/write models for cultural content vs. real-time collaboration optimize performance
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern** - _Rationale:_ External API failures (translation, maps) should not break core cultural interaction features

## Component View

**Core Components:**

- **Authentication Service:** Multi-provider authentication with cultural identity management
- **Cultural Content Service:** Community-driven content management with moderation workflows
- **Community Service:** Location, culture, and activity-based community formation and management
- **Knowledge Exchange Service:** Skill-sharing marketplace with time-banking and cross-cultural matching
- **Collaboration Service:** Real-time project coordination with translation and cultural context preservation
- **Achievement Service:** Recognition system for cultural contributions and cross-cultural bridge-building
- **Moderation Service:** AI-powered content filtering with cultural sensitivity and human oversight
- **Notification Service:** Multi-channel notifications (push, email, SMS) with cultural preferences

## Infrastructure and Deployment Overview

- **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (Firebase ecosystem)
- **Core Services Used:** Firebase Hosting, Cloud Functions, Firestore, Realtime Database, Authentication, Storage, Cloud Messaging
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Firebase CLI configuration files (firebase.json, firestore.rules, storage.rules)
- **Deployment Strategy:** Automated CI/CD pipeline with cultural content review gates
- **Environments:** Development (local Firebase emulators), Staging (Firebase project), Production (Firebase project)
- **Environment Promotion:** `dev` → `staging` (automated on main branch) → `production` (manual approval after cultural review)
- **Rollback Strategy:** Firebase Hosting rollback via CLI, Cloud Functions automatic rollback on health check failure

## Error Handling Strategy

- **General Approach:** Use custom error classes extending base `AppError` for domain-specific errors with cultural context
- **Logging:**
  - Library/Method: Structured logging with Firebase Functions logger and custom correlation IDs
  - Format: JSON with timestamp, severity, correlation ID, user ID (anonymized), cultural context
  - Levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL with cultural sensitivity flags
  - Context: Correlation ID, anonymized user ID, cultural interaction type, service name, operation name
- **Specific Handling Patterns:**
  - External API Calls: Exponential backoff with max 3 retries, circuit breaker for translation services, 30s timeout
  - Cultural Content Errors: Preserve cultural context in error messages, escalate to cultural representatives
  - Real-time Collaboration: Graceful degradation when real-time features fail, offline queue for messages
  - Translation Failures: Fallback to original language with notification, preserve cultural terms

## Coding Standards

**Primary Runtime:** Node.js 20.x for Cloud Functions, modern browsers for PWA
**Style Guide & Linter:** ESLint with TypeScript strict rules + Prettier formatting
**Naming Conventions:**
- Variables: `camelCase`
- Functions/Methods: `camelCase`
- Classes/Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Files: `kebab-case.ts` for components, `camelCase.ts` for utilities
- Cultural Content: Preserve original cultural terms in code comments

**File Structure:** Adhere to project structure with feature-based organization
**Unit Test File Organization:** `*.test.ts` co-located with source files
**Asynchronous Operations:** Always use `async`/`await` for Firebase operations
**Type Safety:** TypeScript strict mode enabled, no `any` types without justification
**Cultural Considerations:** All user-facing strings must support internationalization, cultural terms preserved in original language with translations

### Detailed Language & Framework Conventions

#### TypeScript/React Specifics:
- **Immutability:** Use `Readonly<T>` for props, `as const` for cultural data arrays
- **Functional vs. OOP:** Favor functional components and hooks, use classes only for error boundaries
- **Error Handling Specifics:** Custom error classes for cultural content errors, Firebase error wrapping
- **Cultural Data Handling:** Preserve original cultural terms, use type-safe cultural identifiers
- **Firebase Integration:** Use Firebase v9 modular SDK, implement proper offline handling
- **PWA Requirements:** Service worker for offline cultural content, background sync for community updates

## Overall Testing Strategy

**Tools:** Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests, Firebase Emulator Suite for integration tests
**Unit Tests:**
- **Scope:** Test individual components, hooks, and utility functions with cultural data scenarios
- **Location:** `*.test.ts` co-located with source files
- **Mocking/Stubbing:** Mock Firebase services, external APIs, and cultural content data
- **AI Agent Responsibility:** Generate tests for all cultural interaction logic, cross-cultural matching algorithms, and content moderation workflows

**Integration Tests:**
- **Scope:** Test Firebase Functions with Firestore, cultural content workflows, real-time collaboration
- **Location:** `/tests/integration`
- **Environment:** Firebase Emulator Suite with test cultural data
- **Cultural Testing:** Verify cultural content moderation, cross-cultural matching accuracy, translation preservation

**End-to-End Tests:**
- **Scope:** Complete user journeys including cross-cultural interactions, community joining, content submission
- **Tools:** Playwright with mobile device simulation
- **Cultural Scenarios:** Test multi-language interfaces, cultural content discovery, cross-cultural project collaboration

**Test Coverage:** 80% line coverage target with emphasis on cultural interaction logic quality
**Cultural Test Data:** Comprehensive test datasets representing all 11 South African cultural groups

## Security Best Practices

**Input Sanitization/Validation:**
- Use Zod schemas for all API inputs with cultural content validation
- Validate cultural identifiers against approved lists
- Sanitize user-generated cultural content while preserving cultural terms

**Output Encoding:**
- React automatically escapes JSX content
- Preserve cultural characters and diacritics in all text processing
- Use DOMPurify for rich cultural content with allowlisted cultural formatting

**Secrets Management:**
- Firebase project configuration via environment variables
- API keys stored in Firebase Functions config
- Cultural representative credentials managed through Firebase Auth custom claims

**Dependency Security:**
- Automated vulnerability scanning via GitHub Dependabot
- Regular updates with cultural content compatibility testing
- Audit cultural content processing libraries for security

**Authentication/Authorization Checks:**
- Firebase Auth tokens required for all protected endpoints
- Cultural representative permissions via custom claims
- Community-based authorization for cultural content moderation

**Cultural Content Security:**
- AI-powered content moderation for cultural sensitivity
- Cultural representative approval workflow for heritage content
- Prevent cultural appropriation through community verification
- Preserve cultural context in all security logging

**API Security:**
- HTTPS enforced via Firebase Hosting
- Rate limiting on cultural content submission
- CORS configured for cultural site embedding
- Cultural data anonymization in error logs

**Privacy & Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Optional cultural identity disclosure
- Granular privacy controls for cultural information
- Cultural data portability and deletion rights
- Anonymized cultural interaction analytics
